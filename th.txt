PYTHON:
what is prog lang ????
intrep:

scripting lang or prog:

dynamically typed and statically typed

use case:
--------
Desktop app: chrome,whatsapp,word,365 : 
WEB APPLCATION:w3,a , python: django
Mobile app: :
utilty app:
Data science: AI,ML



python is case sensitive


operators:
operators are the special symbol which is use to perform operation on operands

Type of operators:

unery operators: it required only 1 operands
                : ++a ,a--....
binery operators :
                it required min 2 operands:

ternery operators: ir required min 3 operand

python does not have unery operators

binery operators:
1)arithmertic operators : +, -, * ,/,% , //(floor operators), **
2)realtional operators  :>,<.>=<=, == , !=
3)logical operators: and or not
4)asignment operators : =, +=, -+,...
5)bitwise operators

6)membership operators : in,not in
7)identity operators   : is,is not



TYPE CAST:
implicit type      explicit ty
compiler           programmer

int f =100.20;     int a = (int)100.20;
printf(f) //100

                        broad typecast
                        narrow typecast

                        5 ltr -->10 ltr narrow type cast
                        15 ltr -->2 ltr --> broad type cast

                        float type data --> int --> narrow type cast
                        int type data --> float --> broad type cast

decision making statements:
1)if else
2)switch case / match case..
3)loops

-------------------------------

python does not follow {} braces
it has indentations
